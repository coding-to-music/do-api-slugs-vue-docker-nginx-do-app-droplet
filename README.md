## Project Details

The frontend is provided by a Vue.js powered static site. The backend Go service found in the `api/` directory. It proxies the DigitalOcean API so that an API token is not required on the frontend and set a `Cache-Control` header so the responses are appropriately cached by the CDN.

### Local Development

A Docker Compose file is provide for local development. To build and run both components, use:

    docker-compose up --build

### Deployment

This app is deployed using DigitalOcean App Platform. An example spec for the deployment can be found at `example-spec.yaml`.
